...Still in progress here...

DISCUSSION:
	☐	Intro notes
	☐	What is Bootstrap?
	☐	Why is it important?
	☐	When will we use it?
	Points:
		☐	Mobile developers need to know this is out there.
			☐	Difference between Native & Mobile Web app
	other stuff?

Things to know/discuss/illustrate:
	☐	jQuery & CSS are used to build bootstrap
	☐	Discuss the term responsiveness
	☐	Rule of 12s
	☐	Btns
	☐	Glyphicons
	☐	Fa fa

General Notes:
We need something similar to what I already have done, but expanded some and with more practice. Ideas include giving them broken code later on. Having them fix it. It would be great to possibly end up with a small boostrapped project at the end of the day.

Setup Demo Code and Instructions:
	☐	SETUP DEMO: Setting bootstrap up
	☐	Instructions for instructors and students alike
 
Columns:
	☐	DEMO: Column patterns
	☐	CODEALONG: More column patterns
	☐	PARTNER: Column challenge together.
	☐	INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.
Device Sizes:
	☐	DEMO: Sizes
	☐	CODEALONG: More sizes xl, lg, md, sm
	☐	PARTNER: Another POST request with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
	☐	INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.
Buttons:
	☐	DEMO: Buttons & Button sizes
	☐	CODEALONG: Another button but with codealong
	☐	PARTNER: Another button or series of buttons with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
	☐	INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.
Glyphicons:
	☐	DEMO: Glyphicons

	☐	INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.

Other Fundamental Concepts:
	☐	?

PAIR PROJECT IDEAS:
	☐	Build something bootstrapped in 60 minutes from scratch with HTML, CSS, & BOOTSTRAP?
	☐	Fix some broken code?
	What else?


Share results:
	☐	How should we do this?
