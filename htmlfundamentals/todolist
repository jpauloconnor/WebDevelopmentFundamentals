General Notes:
Some of this section has code already. Angie might have also has been looking into doing some of this. 
In the past, we've done one massive file for several concepts. I think that it's better to create multiple files that have the concepts compartmentalized. 

Resources:
I've noted some resources in some of the files. Would be great to have some of the best nonW3schools.org resources.
