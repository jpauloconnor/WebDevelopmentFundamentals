...Notes still in progress here...

In general, the project and lesson that James taught could be used here. It would be nice to have our own api or find others that we could play around with? Instagram anyone?

DISCUSSION:
 ☐ Intro notes to be added to PPT
  ☐ What is Ajax?
  ☐ Why is it important?
  ☐ When will we use it?
  

 ☐ Things to teach/know
  ☐ jQuery is used with AJAX
  ☐ HTTP VERBS: GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE
  What else?


DEMOS, CODEALONGS, PARTNERS, & INDIVIDUALS:
Description: We need something similar to LearnCode.Academy's lesson and what James did, but our own. Here's a pretty good pattern for what would be great.
  ☐ DEMO: GET instructor demo
  ☐ CODEALONG: Another GET request but with codealong
  ☐ PARTNER: Another GET request with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
  ☐ INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.

  ☐ DEMO: POST instructor demo
  ☐ CODEALONG: Another POST request but with codealong
  ☐ PARTNER: Another POST request with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
  ☐ INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.

  ☐ DEMO: UPDATE instructor demo
  ☐ CODEALONG: Another UPDATE request but with codealong
  ☐ PARTNER: Another UPDATE request with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
  ☐ INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.

  ☐ DEMO: DELETE instructor demo
  ☐ CODEALONG: Another DELETE request but with codealong
  ☐ PARTNER: Another DELETE request with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
  ☐ INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.

PAIR PROJECT:
  ☐ Build something from scratch with HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX
  ☐ Point to another api that we've created.
