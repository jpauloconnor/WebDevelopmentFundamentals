DEMO & CODEALONG
We need something similar to LearnCode.Academy's lesson and what James did, but our own. Here's a pretty good pattern for what would be great.
	DEMO: GET instructor demo
	CODEALONG: Another GET request but with codealong
	PARTNER: Another GET request with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
	INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.

	DEMO: POST instructor demo
	CODEALONG: Another POST request but with codealong
	PARTNER: Another POST request with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
	INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.

	DEMO: UPDATE instructor demo
	CODEALONG: Another UPDATE request but with codealong
	PARTNER: Another UPDATE request with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
	INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.

	DEMO: DELETE instructor demo
	CODEALONG: Another DELETE request but with codealong
	PARTNER: Another DELETE request with a partner(solo is ok, too, but teacher facilitates).
	INDIVIDUAL: Another one, but done individually.
