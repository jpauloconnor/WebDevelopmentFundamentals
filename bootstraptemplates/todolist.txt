General Notes:
This is sort of a wish list. It's been a struggle for people to get into using bootstrap templates.
Would be nice to have a nice lesson/walkthrough for manipulating bootstrap templates.
This would be done on the portfolio lab day? Or it could be done on Day 2 for Homework?

Intro for ppt slides:
  ☐ Why use a bs template?
  ☐ When should I use it?
  ☐ Is it cheating?
  ☐ Where do I get them?
  ☐ When to pay?

Things to discuss might be:
  ☐ Where to start?
  ☐ Min files
  ☐ Index files
  ☐ Dealing with Images
  ☐ Changing the obvious stuff like text
  ☐ How to make it your own?
  ☐ What else?

Partners:
 ☐ This is screaming for partner activity in here.


Github Pages:
  ☐ When to add this one in?
