Wish list
Would be nice to have a nice lesson/walkthrough for manipulating bootstrap templates.
This would be done on the portfolio lab day. 
Would be nice to walkthrough manipulating a boostrap template and making it one's own?

A Step by step walkthrough?

This could be a great team/partner activity...

Things to discuss might be:
	Where to start?
	Min files
	Index files
	Dealing with Images
	Changing the obvious stuff like text
	What else?
