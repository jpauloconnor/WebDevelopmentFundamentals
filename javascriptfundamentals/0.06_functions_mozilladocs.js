//7.8 Working with Pre-Built JS Functions(Alert, prompt, confirm)

//Languages have built-in functions that take the hours out of us coding.

//Uncomment these when needed:
/*
alert("Alert will send a pop up with no option to cancel. You must hit ok.");
prompt("With a prompt, you can ask questions Are you having fun?", "");
confirm("Confirm");
*/

// Check out the first one of the JavaScript docs: 
// https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6fw3zxcx(v=vs.94).aspx
var x = Math.abs(-600);

//What will I get if I call x in the console?

/*TASK;
	Go through and play around with the built-in functions. Try to find 3 that 
	you can implement.
