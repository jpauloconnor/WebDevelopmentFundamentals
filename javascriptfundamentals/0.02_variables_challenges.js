//Challenge #1 - REAL WORLD VARIABLES

/*CHALLENGE: Come up with five different variables. Think of 
real world uses for integers and create variables based on 
those things. A few examples might include: */

var myBankAccount = 2000000; //No dollar sign, we'll discuss how to add this later.
var numberOfHotDogsKobyashiAte = 39; //Check this stat.


console.log(myBankAccount);
console.log("Kobyashi:" + numberOfHotDogsKobyashiAte); /* <----String concatenation

/*-----------------------------------------------------------*/

//Challenge #2 - Make a var called myNumber
//Set it to 0.
//Use shorthand to add 10 to it.
//Then use shorthand to subtract 1.
//Use shorthand to multiple by 9.
//Use shorthand to divide by 7.
//Just for practice, print myNumber to the console between each operation.

var myNumber = 0;
myNumber += 10;
console.log(myNumber);
myNumber -= 1;
console.log(myNumber);
myNumber *= 9;
console.log(myNumber);
myNumber /= 7;
console.log(myNumber);
