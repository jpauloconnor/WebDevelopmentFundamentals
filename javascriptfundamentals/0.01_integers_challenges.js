/*CHALLENGE:  
Create four integers: your age, birth year, graduation year, number of 
    brothers and sisters. Print them to the console. Put comments 
    above each one to identify.*/

//Age
console.log(39);
//Birth year
console.log(1976);
//Graduated high school
console.log(1994);
//Number of Brothers and sisters
console.log(1);

/*-----------------------------------------------------------*/
//Give a few numbers and ask them to make an equation using a modulus that 
//yields that number.

//For instance,
1, 2, 12

//Give some practice modulus problems 
console.log(10 % 3); //What will these give?
console.log(22 % 5);
console.log(100 % 22);
