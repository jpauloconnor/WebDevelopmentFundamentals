General Notes:
I'm not sure what we need to do to teach this better. It would be great to have a separate challenge file for each javascript concept. That's a lot though, and time is an issue. Right now, this needs at least 3 days. Also, more DOM manipulation would be nice.

Resources:
I've noted some resources in some of the files. Would be great to have some of the best nonW3schools.org resources.
