// - PRACTICAL USES FOR STRINGS:
var tweet = "Kanye is broke. No joke!";
var facebookPost = "Just thought I'd share this goofy video of my dog eating our couch.";
var username = 'jamespauloconnor'  
var password = "123456789HELLO"    //Again, you can have numbers in strings.


/*-----------------------------------------------------------*/

//Create one variabe that holds a string that prints out three other variables. The three other variables should be 
//the make, model, and year of your car.

var make = "Ford";
var model = "Focus";
var year = 1999;

var makeModelYear = make + " " + model + " " + year;
console.log(makeModelYear);

//Come up with something else(if time) Use bank account, temperature, etc.
